## Bank Customer Churn Prediction Machine Learning Model

#### By Artem Moshnin

### Problem description

- Some well-known bank has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters.

- This has caused a huge dent in their quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce significantly.

- The idea is to be able to predict which customers are going to churn so that necessary actions/interventions can be taken by the bank to retain such customers.

### Problem description from data science perspective

- To develop a solution for this churn prediction problem I have been using customer data pertaining to his past transactions with the bank and some demographic information.

- I have used this customer data to establish relations/associations between data features & customers' propensity to churn by building a classification model to predict whether the customer will leave the bank or not.

- Furthermore, with an objective of explaning model predictions, I have built multiple visualisations which give insight into which factors are responsible for the churn of the customers.
